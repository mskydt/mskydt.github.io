This had to be my first post - no two ways about it\
I'm learning how to create and maintain a blog using Jekyll on Github Pages.  

I created my first website on GeoCities in 1999 and had fun with HTML and CSS a little while. I forget which neighborhood I was in, though.  

I like to tinker with stuff – technology – and want to share my experiences and learnings along the way. I’m thinking that this blog also might be where I keep my code snippets and whatever walkthroughs, apps, ideas from around the web did it for me creating my home lab, managing backup, improving productivity online etc.
