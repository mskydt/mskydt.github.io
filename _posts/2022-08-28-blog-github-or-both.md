Christian Lempa has a Homelab Youtube channel and a blog. I was watching a video by Christian Lempa the other day: [I'm destroying my website! Whatâ€™s coming next?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnJ1gnDfvZc)

To sum up that video: Christian spends too much of his time updating his blog that he decided to just create Github repositories for the blog-like content and focus on his videos. I kind of like the idea ... but ...

I've just started using Jekyll and GitHub Pages for my own blog, so should I delete that already and just use repositories?
I decided, no. I'm going to keep updating my website/blog with my own writing, but I may put my code and the like directly in useful repos to clone and use directly. 
So I'm sticking with **both**: Blog and Github. I don't do Youtube.

Remember to check out Christians [Github repos](https://github.com/xcad2k) and [YouTube channel - The Digital Life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZNhwA1B5YqiY1nLzmM0ZRg).
