# Mastodon
I never really got into sharing or contributing much on Twitter. I just followed some interesting accounts.
As many others, I've found recent changes prompted me to look to Mastodon.
So I did. I created an account on the server that I found most fitting, so I am now here:

Mastodon seems like a frieldly place where and I feel more comfortable sharing posts.

See you there!
