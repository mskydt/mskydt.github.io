This is just an awesome firewall and I’ll be sure to write about that in the future.Anyway, I never really found ESXi was easy for me to work with. Specifically it was cumbersome to update and I had to roll-back the NIC driver after each update and it was almost necessary to have a monuitor attached.I was never really happy with my backup solution. I had a Windows VM with VEEAM installed. No doubt, VEEAM is pretty much the best you can use, but for my homelab I just wanted something else. I don’t have any extra Windows licenses, so I also had it set up in a non-activated VM with a limited lifespan to follow. And it didn’t work with my pfSense - restore always failed and I never found out why.So, let me try Proxmox I thought!In an effort to collect snippets, code, configurations etc. on Github, rather than my blog, I decided to give this blog post an update and link to the repo in stead.

The fun and learning part has resulted in a virtual firewall. So, I need to take care of my Proxmox cluster and keep it operational, otherwise internet will not work in my home. That’s not good. So in a sense, my homelab is a “production deployment”. Then there are the services I rely on and will come to rely on when built. I want to keep them safe if power outages should occur.RequirementsMy fiber modem is not in my rack with the rest of my home lab. So keeping internet running in case of a power outage is not a requirement. I “just” want my homelab to shut down gracefully after a short while. No need for hours of run-time on the battery.I have a Conbee II USB stick for Zigbee that I’m going to use for a new install of Home Assistant. The last VM broke somthing after … a power outage. Apparently it’s a bit senstive like that.The software solutionNetwork UPS Tools a.k.a. “NUT” is open source and supports many diferent UPS brands. It is very configurable albeit a bit difficult to get working. There are, however, great guides and Youtube videos that have helped me a lot getting it working.Selecting the hardwareMy homelab currently uses about 60 watts which made the following a good choice. Bluewalker PowerWalker VI 850 SHL 850VA / 480W 2x Type F OutputsIt supports NUT and has two normal power outlets with no need for additional investments in a cable converter or new power strip for my rack.Here’s what you need to get startedVisit my GitHub Cheat-Sheet repo where you can find my implementation of Network UPS Tools including rudimentary description and configuration files for the NUT server on a Raspberry Pi, NUT client for my Proxmox hosts and the NUT client configuration for my Synology Diskstation." }, { "title": "Microsoft Power Toys", "url": "/posts/microsoft-power-toys/", "categories": "Windows, Tools", "tags": "microsoft, windows, opensource", "date": "2022-08-28 12:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "“Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity.”I started using Microsoft PowerToys many years ago when it was separate applications (mostly standalone .exe files if I’m not mistaken) I’d download and run on my PC. Nowadays, it’s one application in the systray and you get a whole bunch of different features.The ones I useFancy Zones“FancyZones is a window manager utility for arranging and snapping windows into efficient layouts to improve the speed of your workflow […]”My all-time favorite PowerToys app is Fancy Zones. It is awesome if you have a lot of screen realestate and having many applications open and visible at the same time.I have found that setting up my own overlapping zones works very well. A couple of examples: A tall narrow zone for my ToDo list application (I use Todoist) on the right side of my second monitor which puts it near the center of my viewing field. This comes in handy when I use that same area for a note taking app (that might be OneNote, Obsidian or good old Notepad++) during Team meetings on my primary monitor A small rectangular zone in the far bottom corner of the secondary screen. Nice place for a minimalistic-sized Spotify window A large almost fullscreen zone on the primary monitor. I like it for “big windows” so I can see my background image a bit and retain the ability to drag and drop from the app onto the desktop or vice versa. Very niceKeyboard Manager“The PowerToys Keyboard Manager enables you to redefine keys on your keyboard.”I want to mention just one keycombo that I find very useful. I use both Linux and Windows and closing applications and windows using the same hotkey is nice. On modern keyboards, the function keys often work better with their secondary (or now primary?) functions as media-keys, screen brightness and what have you. So on Windows, the ALT+F4 requires me to hit fn+ÁLT+F4 … with fingers on the same hand preferably. Not going to happen. So I remapped WIN+Q (as in QUIT) to perform the ALT+F4 combo for me. Works great.The ones I want to start usingPowerToys RunThis is a small launcher-app I have pop up on ALT+SPACEBAR. I use it once a week to open a specific spreadsheet rather than having a shortcut for it. I want to use the app more to launch programs and find things. I just like that pressing the WIN key alone bringing up the start menu, allows me to start typing to launch programs. So it’s a hard sell for me.Video Conference MuteI have a dedicated “microphone key” on my Keychron K8 keyboard which I mapped (using Keyboard Manager which I described above) to a shortcut that mutes/unmutes in Microsoft Teams. This works fine. But I’m interested in see if I could benefit from the functionality to “mute” the camera as well as it seems can be done with Video Conference Mute." }, { "title": "Blog, GitHub or both?", "url": "/posts/blog-github-or-both/", "categories": "Blogging", "tags": "blog, github, jekyll", "date": "2022-08-28 12:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "Christian Lempa has a Homelab Youtube channel and a blog.
